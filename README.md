# Lifestyle Tracker GUI

This is a personal project for my Introduction to Programming I class where users can track their lifestyle choices.

## How to Run

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository into your working machine.
2. Make sure that you have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed in your machine. It is recommended to use Java 8 or older.
3. Run the command line. Change your working directory into the directory where you cloned this repository. A bunch of [.java]() files can be found there. Check by typing `dir` on Windows or `ls` on MacOS/Linux in your command line. Once there, enter the following commands:

```console
$ javac *.java
$ java TrackerApp.java
```

## How to Use

1. You can add food by typing the name of the food and inputting how many calories that food has per serving.
2. You can eat food by typing the name of the food and inputting how many servings of that food you ate.

> **Note**: You cannot eat food you haven't added yet.

3. You can add an activity by typing the name of the activity and inputting how many calories are lost per hour of that activity.
4. You can perform an activity by typing the name of the activity and inputting how many hours you did that activity.

> **Note**: You cannot perform an activity you haven't added yet.

5. Once done with your lifestyle logs, you may view the lifestyle report by clicking `Show Lifestyle Report`.

Enjoy!
